This is the repository for Eco-Eats, a browser extension created during Dubhacks 2020. Eco-Eat's mission is to bring awareness and knowledge of sustainable eating to online shopping. We achieve this with a simple browser extension installation process, showing you the carbon footprint of various Amazon foods in real time as you shop.
EcoEats is powered by Flask, Python, Javascript, and various Python libraries.
